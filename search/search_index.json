ThunderShark is thus completely platform and operating system agnostic.</p> <p>Wireshark version 4.0 or later is required.</p>"},{"location":"debugging/thundershark/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>Firstly, the file <code>protocol-thunder-comrpc.lua</code> file needs to be placed in Wireshark's plugins folder.

This file must be placed in the same folder as <code>protocol-thunder-comrpc.lua</code> file (i.e. Wireshark's plugins folder).

Amongst others, they include: callsign, class, exchange_id for announce messages and method name,  parameters, results, interface instance_id and assigned tag for invoke messages. Each message is denoted from which process it originates and which process it addresses. Call and return messages are tied together and additionally the total call duration is calculated.</p> <p>Tags are automatically assigned to instance IDs for convenince (i.e. the user can refer to \"Shell_A\" instead of actual value like 0x0074c18c).</p> <p>The TimeSync plugin can alter system time during packet capture \u2013 this may break message order in the capture file and COM-RPC call duration calculation. For 100% reliable results the TimeSync plugin should be disabled.</p> <p>With current Thunder COM-RPC implementation all <code>AddRef()</code> and many <code>Release()</code> calls are optimized away, being piggy-backed on other COM-RPC calls (note Cached AddRef, and Cached Release fields).</p> <p>Standard Wireshark practices can be used to build display filters and colorizing rules (e.g. to see failed calls use <code>thunder-comrpc.invoke.hresult != 0</code>).

This will be an asynchronous method since a WiFi scan could take some time</p> <ul> <li>This will take no arguments</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Connect - connect to an AP discovered during the scan</p> <ul> <li>This will take one argument - the SSID to connect to</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Disconnect - disconnect from the currently connected AP</p> <ul> <li>This will take no arguments</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>It should also define one notification/event that will be fired when the scan is completed. This notification will contain the list of APs discovered during the scan.</p> <p>As with C++, COM-RPC interfaces are prefixed with the letter \"I\". Therefore the name of this example interface will be <code>IWiFi</code>.</p>"},{"location":"plugin/interfaces/interfaces/#define-interface-id","title":"Define Interface ID","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Ensure your interface has a unique ID!

This approach is most effective in multiprocessor or multicore systems, where threads can be implemented at the kernel level to achieve execution speed. Although this solution has been working well, the lack of standard language support for creating threads has caused serious portability problems.</p> <p>With C++11, <code>std::thread</code> was released. It is based on <code>boost::thread</code>, but is now cross-platform and does not require any dependencies. Therefore, you might now think that this is the way to go; simply use std::thread, and at least we will not need to worry about portability issues.

You could be asking yourself now why does it have to be like that, would it not be easier for embedded devices to have at least a little bit more memory, so that we as developers would not have to worry about it that much?</p> <p>Unfortunately, the answer is no, and there is a very good reason for that. These embedded devices must be as cost-efficient as possible, because saving even a tiny percentage of their cost makes a huge difference when millions of them are being produced.

Once again, it can be noticed that issues like that usually do not happen, for example, when we are building a relatively small PC application, but it is a significant concern in our system that we as developers need to consider.</p> <p>On top of that, it is worth mentioning that the very process of creating a new thread is sometimes much more resource-consuming than the actual operations that are performed by this thread. To avoid that, we need to use a thread pool design pattern, and luckily for us, that is already implemented.

Furthermore, a generalized abstraction between application logic and system interfaces is a prerequisite for portability. That is exactly one of the main goals of Thunder, namely, providing an abstraction layer between plugins and the OS. The general rule of thumb is: do not do something that directly targets the OS in a plugin, since we most likely have an abstraction for that in Thunder; use these abstractions.</p> <p>You may be wondering now why it is so important. Imagine that in the future, we would like to enable our system to work on a new platform, maybe even one that has not been developed yet. Of course, it would be a huge task anyhow, but think about how much easier it would be if abstractions were used in every plugin instead of each one of them directly targeting the OS on their own. From an architectural point of view, the difference is enormous. If each plugin uses the same abstraction layer, we only need to make changes to this functionality, and we are good to go.

So, no worries, it is not like you will have to learn to use something much more complex than, for example, <code>std::thread</code>.</p>"},{"location":"utils/threading/worker-pool/#most-important-features-and-methods","title":"Most important features and methods","text":"<p>The main purpose of this document is to indicate how to use Worker Pool, and, of course, it cannot be done without showcasing some of its features.

Without going into too many details, this class template will allow us to create jobs. The concept of a job could be described as follows: inside the plugin, we implement a piece of code that should be executed in a separate thread; afterwards, we submit our job to Thunder (a piece of code responsible for that is in the listing below), and it takes care of it for us. In a bit more detail, the Worker Pool will first try to find a worker (simply a thread inside the thread pool) who is currently not doing anything and will wait until such a worker is found. Next, it will assign the job to a worker, and that is about it.</p> <pre><code>bool Submit()\n{\n    ProxyType&lt;IDispatch&gt; job(ThreadPool::JobType&lt;IMPLEMENTATION&gt;::Submit());\n\n    if (job.IsValid()) {\n        IWorkerPool::Instance().Submit(job);\n    }\n\n    return (ThreadPool::JobType&lt;IMPLEMENTATION&gt;::IsIdle() == false);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>So now you know how to create a job and what that means. You have yet to find out how to do that in the code, but that is going to be covered in the next section. Additionally, it was mentioned that the job can be submitted, but that is not the only thing you can do with a job. It is also possible to reschedule or revoke a job. All of this can be done with the use of very simple methods, namely <code>Submit()</code>, <code>Reschedule()</code> and <code>Revoke()</code>, which can be found in the following listing.</p> <pre><code>void Revoke()\n{\n    Core::ProxyType&lt;IDispatch&gt; job(ThreadPool::JobType&lt;IMPLEMENTATION&gt;::Revoke());\n    if (job.IsValid() == true) {\n        Core::IWorkerPool::Instance().Revoke(job);\n        ThreadPool::JobType&lt;IMPLEMENTATION&gt;::Revoked();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You might be wondering what exactly stands behind a job, that is, what actually happens, for example, when the job is submitted. As mentioned above, the job is an object of a class template <code>JobType&lt;&gt;</code>. The key word here is template. When creating a job, you should include a class reference in this template. Then, you need to create a method called <code>Dispatch()</code> inside this class, and in this method you put everything that should be executed - about as difficult as using <code>std::thread</code>, but infinitely more efficient.</p>"},{"location":"utils/threading/worker-pool/#coding-examples","title":"Coding examples","text":"<p>In this subsection, we show what steps to take to code an explanatory job. First, we need to create it as a private member of a class, which can be seen below:</p> <pre><code>Core::WorkerPool::JobType&lt;className&amp;&gt; _job;\n</code></pre> <p>As you could have guessed, you simply substitute <code>className</code> with the name of a class that will be used inside a plugin to submit a job, and that is almost it. After declaring the member variable <code>_job</code>, we have yet to initialize it with some value. If you predicated that the value was simply going to be a pointer to our class, you were right. The easiest way to do that would be inside every constructor of the class, and an example of this can be found below:</p> <pre><code>FileObserver()\n    : _callback(nullptr)\n    , _position(0)\n    , _path()\n    , _job(*this)\n{\n}\n</code></pre> <p>After that, it is only necessary to create the <code>Dispatch()</code> method, and we will be able to submit our job with <code>_job.Submit()</code>. Furthermore, it is important not to forget about the <code>Revoke()</code> method and to know when to call it. Consider a situation where the job is submitted and the class is destructed afterwards. It is essential to remember what happens after a job submission inside the Worker Pool, namely, it is waiting for any worker to be available. If the class is destroyed, either before a worker is assigned or before an actual job is finished, you will surely run into some problems. Because of that, it is worth to keep in mind the lifetime of the object you pass into the <code>JobType&lt;&gt;</code> template as a parameter, meaning that you must make sure it is kept alive as long as the job is submitted and/or running. Depending on the situation, the <code>Revoke()</code> method will either synchronously stop the potential run or wait for the run to complete.</p> <pre><code>FileObserver()\n    : _callback(nullptr)\n    , _position(0)\n    , _path()\n    , _job(*this)\n{\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If, for example, we did not pass a class to the template as a reference, the class would become a composite of the <code>JobType&lt;&gt;</code> object and its lifetime would then always be equal to the <code>JobType&lt;&gt;</code> object, which is, of course, not intended. The fact that we pass a reference to a class makes it mandatory to call <code>Revoke()</code> in its destructor, and the same applies to the <code>Unregister()</code> method when callbacks are used, as you can see in the following listing.</p> <pre><code>~FileObserver()\n{\n    _job.Revoke();\n    ASSERT(_callback == nullptr);\n    if (_callback != nullptr)\n    {\n        Unregister();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A basic example of properly using the Worker Pool to perform a relatively easy task can be found inside <code>rdkcentral/ThunderNanoServices/FileTransfer/FileTransfer.h</code> in the <code>FileObserver</code> class, which by the way is another useful and underused functionality in Thunder, which will be further described in a different document.</p>"},{"location":"utils/threading/worker-pool/#conclusions","title":"Conclusions","text":"<p>To sum up, the main idea is not to reinvent the wheel.
